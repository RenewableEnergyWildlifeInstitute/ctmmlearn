# PROJECTIONS
####################

# what projection are the buffalo in
projection(buffalo)

# You want a projection that is locally flat over your data (to minimize distortion).
# By default, as.telemetry() will choose a two-point equidistant projection, which is
# safer for migratory species, but does not preserve North=up.

# show north on plot
compass()

#! center the projection on the geometric median of the data
projection(buffalo) <- median(buffalo)

projection(buffalo)

# now North=up, which is fine for this dataset
